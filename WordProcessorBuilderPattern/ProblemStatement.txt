You’re building a word processor similar to Word. The user can add text or 
image elements to a document and then export it to a variety of different 
formats such as HTML, text, and so on. Note that if the selected format is HTML, all text and image elements are 
written to an HTML document. If the selected format is text, however, only 
text elements are written to a text file. What pattern you will use to solve this problem? and why?
